# Animated-Vector-Drawable-Path-Morphing-
A vector drawable is a type of drawable that is scalable without getting pixelated or blurry. The AnimatedVectorDrawable class (and AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat for backward-compatibility) lets you animate the properties of a vector drawable, such as rotating it or changing the path data to morph it into a different image.
